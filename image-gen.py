There is a ladder, made of light colored wood leaned up against the cube on the side and it reaches the top of the cube. There is a white horse with brown patches and it's standing next to the cube not moving. There are desert flowers - they are pink with spikey leaves and they are growing out of the sand. They are next to the horse - the horse is in between the flowers and the cube. A storm is not directly over the desert but is approaching it. it has big rain clouds and is blowing closer to the cube, horse, and flowers.""" # ADD .format(<scene>, <cube>, etc.)
